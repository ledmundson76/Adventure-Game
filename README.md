This is an on-going choose your own adventure game that I am currently developing. I am currently trying to split up the code into different files so it is easier to read.
After I implement different files, I want to implement more paths to choose from, more character and inventory data, more random functions, and better player stat trackers like if there is different
gear, different armour, and what percent of damage is done, what percentage of health is lost, etc.
